# OASIS INFOBYTE TASK NumberGuessingGame Approach 
The task is to write a Java program in which a user will get K trials to guess a randomly generated number.
The approach is to generate a random number using Math.random() method in Java.
Now using a loop, take K input from the user and for each input print whether the number is smaller or larger than the actual number.
If within K trials the user guessed the number correctly, print that the user won.
Else print that he was not able to guess and then print the actual number.
